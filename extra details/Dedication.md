# DEDICATION

We dedicate this project in the name of **Allah the Almighty** who is present when we are planning and whose preciseness fulfills our dream.

Special dedication also to our **Parents**, whose prayers, love, support, and motivation are with us in each moment of life. Their sacrifices have been the silent force behind our success.

Furthermore, we love to dedicate this work to our respected **Teachers** of the Computer Science Department, our **Best Friends**, **Supportive Students of University of Turbat (UoT)**, and all our class fellows for the continual impact of knowledge and encouragement.

Finally, we dedicate this project to our **Supervisor** and the **Head of the Computer Science Department** for their motivation, guidance, and unwavering support throughout the development of **360 Cafe and Outlets**.
