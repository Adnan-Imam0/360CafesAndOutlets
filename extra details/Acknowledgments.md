# ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Thanks to **Allah the Rahman and Merciful**, whose help covers the entire universe, whose powers are indefinable, and who guided us to complete our project under **Mr. Bilal ur Rahman’s** supervision with his encouragement and guidance.

We are incredibly grateful to our supervisor for his vision and his persistence upon the values of hard work on this project. Without him, it may not have been possible to complete **360 Cafe and Outlets** within the limited duration.

We would also like to express our deep respect to **Dr. Rashid Ali**, **Mr. Mamoon Rasheed**, and all other faculty members of the **Computer Science Department** for their support and the valuable time they invested in us.

Furthermore, it has been a beautiful journey with our classmates and the faculty of the Computer Science Department and others as well.

Lastly, we would like to thank our institute, **University of Turbat**, for providing us a platform to build such an impactful project within the Turbat environment. This achievement would not have been possible without this supportive ecosystem.
